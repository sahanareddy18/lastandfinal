# Loyalty Points System Fix

## Problem
Loyalty points were not being added to the customer database when invoices were created.

## Root Cause
The loyalty points system was only working if the customer already existed in the database. When creating invoices through the frontend, customers were not being automatically added to the database, so the loyalty points logic couldn't find them.

## Solution
Modified the `salesController.js` to automatically create customers in the database if they don't exist when a sale is made.

### Changes Made:

1. **Enhanced Customer Lookup Logic** in `lastandfinal/backend/controllers/salesController.js`:
   ```javascript
   // Before: Only updated existing customers
   const customerToUpdate = await Customer.findOne({ customerContact: customer.contact });
   if (customerToUpdate) {
     // Update loyalty points
   }

   // After: Creates customer if not found
   let customerToUpdate = await Customer.findOne({ customerContact: customer.contact });
   if (customerToUpdate) {
     // Update existing customer's loyalty points
   } else {
     // Create new customer automatically with loyalty points
     const newCustomer = new Customer({
       customerName: customer.name,
       customerContact: customer.contact,
       email: customer.email || '',
       loyaltyPoints: loyaltyPointsEarned
     });
     await newCustomer.save();
   }
   ```

2. **Added Debug Logging** to track loyalty points operations:
   - Sale amount and loyalty points earned
   - Customer lookup results
   - Loyalty points updates
   - New customer creation

3. **Removed Transaction Logic** that was causing issues with non-replica set MongoDB

## How It Works Now

1. **When you create an invoice:**
   - The system calculates loyalty points (₹100 = 1 point)
   - Looks for the customer in the database
   - If found: Updates their existing loyalty points
   - If not found: Creates a new customer with the earned loyalty points

2. **Loyalty Points Rules:**
   - ₹100 spent = 1 loyalty point
   - Minimum 50 points required for redemption
   - 1 point = ₹1 redemption value

## Testing
The fix has been tested and verified:
- ✅ New customers are automatically created with loyalty points
- ✅ Existing customers get their loyalty points updated
- ✅ Loyalty points calculation is correct (floor division)
- ✅ Debug logging shows all operations

## Result
Now when you create invoices, loyalty points will automatically be added to the customer database, whether the customer existed before or not.
